# Burger Shop

Burger shop is a full-stack project using React for frontend and Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend. The current Repo is associated with the frontend that has been deployed on Netlify.

Live Demo: [Burger Shop](https://burger-shop-final-project.netlify.app/)

## Usage

This is an online burger shop where users can add meals, drinks, or coffee to their order. The checkout button only gets activated if a user at least selects one of the products. On the following page, the user must enter the name and phone number to associate the order with the current user. Then, the user would be able to see the order and total price. 
The payment component is working on the frontend, however, it is not connected to the backend.

## Challenges
- Generate a REST API and communication between the React application and API.
- making associations between models in the database. Particularly, the association between the products and orders.
- Generate a user in the database and make the created user_id accessible in all react components.

## To be implemented
in future, the following features will be implemented:

- Connect the Stripe payment to the backend.
- Add user authentications to the app.

## Bugs/Issues
- Payment component is not connected to the backend
